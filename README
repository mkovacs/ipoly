iPoly manipulates polynomials over an inner product space.

Say, you're solving the equations of ray-sphere intersection.

ray:      H + m*I = P
sphere: (P - C)^2 = r^2

iPoly can collect the coefficients of m's powers.

command:
ipoly "(H + m*I - C)^2 - r^2" -t m

output:
0 -> C^2 - 2*(C*H) + H^2 - r^2
1 -> 2*(H*I) - 2*(C*I)
2 -> I^2
